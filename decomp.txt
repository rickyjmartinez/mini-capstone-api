place order backend 

* Write out all the steps necessary for your mini-capstone backend to allow users to purchase products. (aim for roughly 5 to 10 steps)
* For now, a user can submit an order for any quantity of a single product (we are not implementing a “shopping cart” where an order contains multiple products).
* Do not write any code for this exercise; just focus on decomposing the different steps necessary to complete the feature.

1. create orders controller
2. create order post route 
3. create action in order controller 
4. test by signing in as user (authentication here)
5. happy/sad paths for create action in controller 
6. log in and create order 
7. check postico/db to see if order saves. also check rails console. 


other stuff needed to figure out/would be nice

1. show order summary => render :show? 
2. show order total with product info and tax
